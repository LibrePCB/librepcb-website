### Forum

The best way for discussing improvement ideas or getting help is our
[discussion forum](https://librepcb.discourse.group/). Sign up and join the
conversation!

### Chat

We also have a development channel on IRC and a group on Telegram. The two
chats are bridged, so you can join any one of them to see all conversations.

* [#librepcb on Libera.Chat](https://web.libera.chat?channels=#librepcb)
* [LibrePCB_dev on Telegram](https://telegram.me/LibrePCB_dev)

Note that the chat is mainly for discussing the development of LibrePCB. To get
help, the [forum](https://librepcb.discourse.group/) is better suited.
