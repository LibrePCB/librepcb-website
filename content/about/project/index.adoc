LibrePCB was started in 2013 by its founder and lead developer
{{< cloak "Urban Bruhin" >}} (https://github.com/ubruhin[@ubruhin]),
an electrical engineer from Switzerland. Since then it is actively
maintained and continuously improved in his free time beside a full-time
job. After a long concept & testing phase, the first official stable
release was published in 2018. Currently he's trying to push the
LibrePCB development by working full-time on it.

From time to time the LibrePCB project is presented at
https://fosdem.org[FOSDEM], see the video recordings below.

The application is written in C++20/Rust/Qt and built with CMake.
