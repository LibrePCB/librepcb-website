The time we can put into the LibrePCB development heavily varies on how
much free time we have, since the income of LibrePCB is not sufficient
for hiring a full-time developer. Therefore we can't commit for a
concrete roadmap.

== icon:list-check[] Milestones

However, we do track issues we want to resolve in the next release with
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/milestones[GitHub Milestones].
But note that many new issues will be added while already working on
a milestone, so the milestone issues are just an incomplete snapshot.

== icon:arrows-spin[] Release Cycle

A new release will be published when it's ready. But generally we try to
release a new version twice, or at least once, a year.

== icon:signs-post[] Long-Term Goals

Of course we want to make LibrePCB a feature-rich EDA tool for long-term.
This includes for example (in arbitrary order):

* Hierarchical sheets
* Schematic buses
* Push&shove router
* Length-matched traces
* Many advanced PCB features (e.g. blind/buried vias)
* 3D board viewer
* SPICE simulation
* ...and many more!

In addition, we have some innovative ideas we don't want to disclose yet ;-)
