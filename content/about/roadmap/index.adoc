The time we can put into the LibrePCB development heavily varies on how
much free time we have, since the income of LibrePCB is not sufficient
for hiring a full-time developer. Therefore we can't commit for a
concrete roadmap.

== icon:list-check[] Milestones

However, we do track issues we want to resolve in the next release with
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/milestones[GitHub Milestones].
But note that many new issues will be added while already working on
a milestone, so the milestone issues are just an incomplete snapshot.

== icon:arrows-spin[] Release Cycle

A new release will be published when it's ready. But generally we try to
release a new version twice, or at least once, a year.

== icon:signs-post[] Long-Term Goals

Of course we want to make LibrePCB a feature-rich EDA tool for long-term.
This includes for example (in arbitrary order):

* Hierarchical sheets
* Schematic buses
* Push&shove router
* Length-matched traces
* SPICE simulation
* ...and many more!

In addition, we have some innovative ideas we don't want to disclose yet ;-)

== icon:ban[] Non-Goals

There is not an explicit _feature_ we don't like to implement. But generally
*we focus on stability, reliability, good concepts and a sane file format
rather than on a huge amount of features*. So instead of implementing many
cool but half-done & buggy features we prefer to implement only a few but
carefully designed, reliable features.

In addition, any new feature must comply with our belief of providing an
application which works on virtually any platform. Therefore we don't
implement features which rely on bleeding-edge technology not available
on some computers one might want to run LibrePCB.
