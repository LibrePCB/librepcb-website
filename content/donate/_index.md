LibrePCB is an open source project – it's made by the community, for the
community. This means that everyone can use LibrePCB without paying for it.

But if you like LibrePCB, please consider supporting the ongoing development of
LibrePCB with a donation. The more donations are made, the more time we can put
into the development of new features to make LibrePCB even more powerful.


### Ordering PCBs

You want to order a PCB designed with LibrePCB? In that case you can support
LibrePCB by simply ordering your PCBs using our
[LibrePCB Fab](https://fab.librepcb.org) service which is directly integrated
into LibrePCB. Just
[click on the *Order PCB* toolbutton](https://docs.librepcb.org/#gettingstarted-order-fab) to get started. After the order is placed, our
partner [AISLER](https://aisler.net/partners/librepcb)
will automatically make a donation to LibrePCB -- without any cost for you!
