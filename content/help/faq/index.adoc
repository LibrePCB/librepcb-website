[#why-should-i-use-librepcb]
=== Why should I use LibrePCB instead of _XYZ_?

* It's very easy to get started with; there's no need to spend lots of time learning.
* Working with LibrePCB means more fun and less trouble thanks to its
  link:{{< relref "features/library-concept/index.adoc" >}}[advanced library concept].
* Installing and updating libraries is much simpler and faster thanks to the
  link:{{< relref "features/library-management/index.adoc" >}}[built-in library management].
* Ordering PCBs is way simpler, faster and less error-prone thanks to the
  link:{{< relref "features/fabrication-service/index.adoc" >}}[integrated fabrication service].
* Version control of libraries and projects works much better thanks to its
  link:{{< relref "features/file-format/index.adoc" >}}[well-designed file format].
* ...and many more things. Check out the link:../features/[feature pages]
  for more details.

[#why-another-eda-tool]
=== Why another EDA tool? Why not contributing to tool _XYZ_?

Each of the existing open-source EDA tools has a different target audience,
a different focus, and different opinions about how things should be done.
It makes no sense for LibrePCB developers to work on another tool (e.g. KiCad)
just to be able to implement the small subset of our ideas they agree on.
It's almost impossible (and senseless) to fundamentally change the mindset
of other EDA tool developers.

In the end, it's good for users to have multiple _different_ EDA tools to
choose from. Of course we don't develop multiple _identical_ tools.

[#why-a-new-file-format]
=== Why introducing a new, non-standardized file format?

From time to time, people ask why every EDA package invented its own file
format instead of developing a standardized, open file format to allow
data exchange between different EDA packages.

Although this sounds like a great idea, in practice it makes no sense,
unfortunately. The data structure of a PCB project obviously has to
reflect the feature set and concepts of the tool itself; for example, if
the tool uses UUIDs for referencing objects, the file format has to
reflect this. If we introduced a file format to be used by multiple
EDA packages, it would mean that the general concepts of these packages
must be identical as well (otherwise they wouldn't be compatible with the
file format). But it makes no sense to develop multiple _identical_ EDA
packages. The same applies to LibrePCB: we want to provide you with an EDA
tool that is _different_ (from our point of view: _better_) than other
tools, and that's only possible with a different file format.

[#is-it-stable]
=== The version number is very low, is it already usable?

Yes it is! It is working very well and can be used productively to create
PCBs. However, just don't expect advanced features yet (e.g. hierarchical sheets).
Features like that will be implemented in future releases.

Check out
https://librepcb.discourse.group/t/projects-madewithlibrepcb/99[#madewithlibrepcb]
to see pictures of some PCBs made with LibrePCB.

[#where-is-library-element]
=== I can't find _XYZ_ in the libraries, where is it?

Providing high-quality libraries requires a huge amount of time until they
are somewhat "complete" (that's impossible anyway). If you didn't find what
you're looking for, it probably doesn't exist yet.

But there's good news: With LibrePCB it's very easy to create your own
library elements! Just
https://librepcb.org/docs/quickstart/create-local-library/[create a local library] and
https://librepcb.org/docs/quickstart/create-library-elements/[add the elements you need].

In addition, you could ask in https://librepcb.discourse.group/[our forum]
if other users already created the library elements you need.
