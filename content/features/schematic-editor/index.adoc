== icon:forward[] Lazy Device Assignment

LibrePCB allows you to first draw a rough schematic without worrying about
footprints or part numbers yet. The exact parts can optionally be assigned
later when starting with the layout. This can save a lot of time during the
iterative process in the design phase.
