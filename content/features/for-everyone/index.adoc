There are many EDA tools out there, but most of the tools are only available
for a very limited target audience -- e.g. due to high costs, restrictive
license terms, or because they simply don't run on your computer.

We think good EDA tools should be available for everyone. That's why
*LibrePCB is open-source, comes with no costs, no restrictions, no limitations
and is available for many different platforms and languages*.

== icon:laptop[] Multi-Platform

LibrePCB runs on virtually any operating system:
*Windows, macOS, Linux, UNIX, BSD, Solaris, ...*

And even on different CPU architectures:
*Intel/AMD x86, ARM, Apple M1, ...*

[NOTE]
====
We can provide official binaries only for the most common platforms. For
other platforms, LibrePCB is available either from a corresponding package
management system or needs to be compiled from sources.

To make LibrePCB more useful for people around the world, it is available in
https://www.transifex.com/librepcb/librepcb-application/languages/[{{< param "numberOfTranslations" >}} different languages].

[NOTE]
====
The completeness of the translations differ between the languages.
See link:{{< relref "contribute/index.adoc" >}}[here] how you can help
improving the translations.

== icon:users[] From Beginners to Experts

Getting started with professional EDA tools is usually very hard -- you need
to invest a lot of time until you are able to work efficiently with it. On
the other hand, EDA tools for beginners are easy to learn, but very limited
in functionality.

LibrePCB tries to close the gap between these two worlds -- basic tasks are
very simple and intuitive, while still having more advanced features available.
So you can get productive very quickly without later ending up in limitations.
