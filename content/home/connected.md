Installing libraries and ordering PCBs has never been easier than with
LibrePCB. The
[integrated library manager]({{< relref "features/library-management/index.adoc" >}})
and
[PCB fabrication service]({{< relref "features/fabrication-service/index.adoc" >}})
can save you a lot of time and frustration. But of course LibrePCB can also
be used fully offline.
