I'm happy to announce that once again there will be a LibrePCB talk at the
next https://fosdem.org/[FOSDEM], which takes place in February 2024!

After the Open Hardware devroom did not exist at the last FOSDEM in 2023,
luckily this devroom will be back at FOSDEM 2024 where I'll give a
status update about the LibrePCB project. So if you're curious about the
progress of LibrePCB (also behind the scenes), feel free to join the
conference -- either in person or via live stream.

* Talk: https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-3087-librepcb-status-update/[LibrePCB Status Update]
* Track: https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/track/open-hardware-and-cadcam/[Open Hardware and CAD/CAM]
* Where: Room H.1308 (Rolin), ULB Solbosch Campus, Brussels, Belgium
* When: 3 & 4 February 2024

I'm looking forward to meet you at FOSDEM 24!
