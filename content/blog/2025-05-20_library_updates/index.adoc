In the past few months our libraries got some nice contributions and also
I created more than 70 important library elements and 285 3D models by myself
to provide you more ready-to-use components and devices: screw terminals,
push buttons, mounting holes and more!

Changes
-------

The rather incomplete libraries are a major criticism of LibrePCB, which
also shows our https://show.forms.app/librepcb/feedback[user feedback survey]
where this is at rank one of things to be improved (but we would also assume it
without the survey). In the past few months I have worked a lot on creating
more of the important library elements to improve that situation. Also we got
some contributions from the community which are now part of our official
libraries.

Here's an overview of the library elements which were added between
November 2024 and April 2025:

LibrePCB Base::

  (thanks to https://github.com/dbrgn[@dbrgn]!)

Behind the Scenes
-----------------

Many of the new library elements were somehow repetitive (screw terminals,
capacitors, mounting holes etc.), therefore I extended
https://github.com/LibrePCB/librepcb-parts-generator[librepcb-parts-generator]
with new scripts to generate a large percentage of them.

These scripts also use https://cadquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[CadQuery]
to generate STEP models, thus almost all of the new packages come with
3D models out of the box! In addition, all new devices come with MPNs so you
will get an accurate BOM for your project without entering MPNs manually.

What's Next?
------------

After these library additions, I'm now priorizing the development of
link:{{< relref "blog/2024-10-17_roadmap_2.0/index.adoc" >}}[LibrePCB 2.0]
where I'm making pretty good progress. But I have already planned to make
more library contributions later with a focus on modules & devkits (like
Arduino, ESP32 etc.) since those things are used in many projects nowadays.

I'm open to receive suggestions about which modules to be added, please tell
us in our https://librepcb.discourse.group/[discussion forum] or in our
https://matrix.to/#/#librepcb:matrix.org[chat]!

And don't forget to update your workspace libraries to get all the new
library improvements! Some of the libraries are even entirely new so you
might want to install them too.
