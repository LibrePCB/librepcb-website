**The stable release 0.1.0 is out!**

Since the release candidate 0.1.0 RC2 three weeks ago, no critical bugs were
reported, so we decided to finally publish the stable release 0.1.0. The
changelog compared to 0.1.0 RC2 is very short:


### Changelog

#### Library Editor:
- Fix saving of library URL
- Fix saving of component property "schematic-only"


### File Format Stability

As this is an official stable release, the file format is also considered as
stable and you can expect that any project created with that release will be
loadable with future releases of LibrePCB. So now you can really start using
LibrePCB productively :)

***Attention:*** *This is not the case for the development version (e.g. the
`master` branch of our Git repository), so you should really use this official
release for productive work instead of the development version! In addition, we (of course) can't
guarantee that official releases are free of bugs and we aren't responsible for
any issues caused by a software bug or something else. We recommend to use
version control systems or regularly create backups of projects anyway, no
matter which EDA tool you use.*
