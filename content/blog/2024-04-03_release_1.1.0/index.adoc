title: LibrePCB 1.1.0 Released
author: U. Bruhin

I'm happy to announce LibrePCB 1.1.0 which was released today! Once again there
are some exciting new features, check out the details below.

Highlights
----------

Live Parts Information (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1313[#1313])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Who didn't already finish a PCB project and then -- while ordering the parts --
realized that several parts in the schematic are obsolete, not in stock or
unexpectedly expensive? This is annoying and wastes time for evaluating new
parts and adjusting the PCB layout again.

Luckily with LibrePCB 1.1.0 you now see much earlier in the design phase
which parts are good to use! When adding new parts to a schematic, you'll
immediately see their lifecycle status, availability, price and more:

{{< imglink "Live Part Information" "live-part-information.gif" >}}

In addition, the BOM export dialog gives you an overview about the status
of all parts used in the project and even shows you their total price:

[.imageblock.rounded-window.window-border]
{{< imglink "BOM Export" "bom-export.png" >}}

Since such information can change quickly, it is not stored in our libraries
but requested through our online API on demand. The actual data about parts
is kindly sponsored by https://partstack.com/[Partstack] -- without their
support, it would not be possible for us to provide this feature.

[TIP]
====
In case you worry about this new internet-based feature: We take privacy
very seriously and absolutely no personal data (e.g. IP address) will be
forwarded to any third-party (not even to Partstack). Also it is possible
to disable this feature. See details https://api.librepcb.org/api/[here].

EAGLE Project Import (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1288[#1318])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Still using EAGLE and looking for alternatives now since
https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/blog/future-of-autodesk-eagle-fusion-360-electronics/[it has been abandoned]?
Or already using LibrePCB, but still having many old EAGLE projects?

No problem -- in addition to the already existing EAGLE library import,
you can now even import whole EAGLE projects, allowing you to smoothly
migrate from EAGLE to LibrePCB! Well, at least within some limitations
since such importers by design can't be lossless ðŸ˜‰ However, we think
it works very well for many EAGLE projects so you should definitively give
it a try.

For more details about its limitations, check out
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1288[this pull request].
If you encounter a problem not mentioned there, please

Interactive Device Pinout Assignment (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1309[#1309])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.window-border.right.ms-4]
{{< imglink "Interactive Pinout" "interactive-pinout.gif" >}}

The most important step of creating a new device is to define its pinout,
which can be quite cumbersome and error-prone, especially for devices with
many pads. This changes with LibrePCB 1.1.0:

Any pads whose name match with a component signal (e.g. a connector with pads
`1..20`) can now be assigned with just a single click.

And for any remaining pads, an interactive mode helps you to do the
assignment pad by pad. A filtering feature and extensive keyboard shortcuts
make this mode very efficient.

Improved Support for Dark Themes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{{< imglink "Dark Theme" "dark-toolbar.png" >}}

This is actually just a small change, but thanks to
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1326[theme-aware toolbar icons]
and https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1310[improved colors],
LibrePCB is now much better usable (and looks better) on systems with a
dark theme.

Qt6, 64-bit Windows Releases, Offline Installer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally I don't consider internal technical changes as a highlight, but
this time a technical change has notable impact especially for Windows users.
Starting with LibrePCB 1.1.0,
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1317[we now support Qt6],
the successor of the C++ toolkit Qt5 which LibrePCB is based on since its
very beginning. Together with Qt6 we now provide 64-bit releases for Windows.

In addition, this new 64-bit release is now built with
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1340[a new installer toolkit].
Instead of downloading LibrePCB from the internet during the installation,
this is now an offline installer not requiring internet anymore. Due to the
different CPU architecture, the new installer defaults to the location
`C:\Program Files\LibrePCB` instead of `C:\Program Files (x86)\LibrePCB`.
During installation it will ask you to uninstall any previous LibrePCB version.

[WARNING]
====
Note that these *Qt6/64-bit builds are currently considered beta*. For
productive use we recommend the still available Qt5 (32-bit on Windows) builds
for now, as promoted on the download page. For upcoming releases we plan
to drop these Qt5 builds so only the Qt6 builds will be available then.
====

[NOTE]
====
The move to Qt6 forced us to *drop support for Windows 7, Windows 8 and any
32-bit versions* -- upcoming releases will require at least Windows 10 64-bit.
Since Windows 7 and 8 are already end-of-life for quite some time, it is highly
recommended anyway to not use these systems anymore. But for now you can
still use the Qt5 builds on them.
