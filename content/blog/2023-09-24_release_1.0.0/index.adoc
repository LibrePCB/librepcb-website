After a few weeks of testing the RC1 and bugfixing, finally the stable
release of LibrePCB 1.0 is finished and available for download! Check out
the awesome new features and the migration notes below.

Highlights
----------

Advanced PCB Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the goals of this release was to get rid of several limitations which
made LibrePCB 0.1.x unsuitable for many PCB projects. Therefore the following
board editor features are now available:

- Thermal relief pads in planes
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1160[#1160])
- Blind & buried vias
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1163[#1163])
- Plated and non-plated slots
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1071[#1071],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1076[#1076])
- Keepout zones
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1167[#1167])
- Rounded and custom footprint pad shapes
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1102[#1102],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1103[#1103])
- Configurable automatic stop mask and solder paste on pads
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1137[#1137])
- Fiducials and other pad types
  (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1142[#1142],
  https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1143[#1143])

So there should be no show stopper anymore which prevents you from using
LibrePCB for more complex PCB designs! ðŸ’ª

3D Viewer & STEP Export (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1156[#1156])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally it's possible to review the PCB design in a realistic 3D viewer,
with proper rendering of copper layers, solder resist and silkscreen!
Even devices are rendered if STEP models have been assigned to their
packages in the library. In addition, the whole PCB can be exported as a
STEP model so it can be opened in a mechanical CAD.

For a detailed description, check out the
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1156[corresponding pull request] --
or just watch this nice GIF! ðŸ˜€

[.imageblock.rounded-window.window-border]
{{< imglink "3D Viewer" "board-editor-3d.gif" >}}

[WARNING]
====
Since your existing projects do not contain any 3D models yet, initially
only the plain PCB will be rendered without any devices on it. To get the
devices appearing, you need to add 3D models to the corresponding packages
in your libraries. Afterwards you need to trigger *Project ã€‰Update
Project Library* to update the packages in your project.

Our official libraries already contain some 3D models, but there are
still many packages without 3D model. Just look for library updates from
time to time.
====

MPN Management & Assembly Variants (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1180[#1180])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is now also possible to specify manufacturer part numbers (MPNs) in
the library so that you don't need to manually enter them every time you add
a component to a schematic. These MPNs will then be exported to the BOM
to get very accurate information about the parts you need to order.

[.imageblock.rounded-window.window-border]
{{< imglink "Add Parts" "add-parts.png" >}}

But adding just one MPN is sometimes not enough. Probably most hardware
engineers experienced supply chain issues in the last few years and learned
how important it is to define second source parts. With LibrePCB you can now
even explicitly specify alternative parts in the schematic which will get
exported to the BOM too!

In addition, it is now possible to define multiple assembly variants of a
project, for example to omit ("do not mount") specific parts in some of the
product variants. For more details about this feature, please take a look at
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1180[its full explanation].

Unified Production Data Files Generator (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1194[#1194])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With LibrePCB 1.0 you can now export production data like a pro! icon:rocket[]
Thanks to so-called _output jobs_, this task has become very easy, fast,
flexible and reproducible:

[.imageblock.rounded-window.window-border]
{{< imglink "Output Jobs" "output-jobs.gif" >}}

With the archiving job, there's even no need anymore to manually create
a ZIP file for sending Gerber files to your PCB manufacturer. Just
specify the ZIP filename and which job outputs shall be contained, and
LibrePCB creates the ZIP in a few milliseconds for you.

These jobs can not only be executed from the graphical interface, but also
from the command-line. So if you like to automate the generation of output
files (e.g. on a continuous integration system), now you can!

Migration Notes
---------------

Workspace & Libraries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When you open your existing workspace the first time with LibrePCB 1.x, it
needs to be upgraded to the new file format. A wizard will automatically
guide you through this (very simple) process. Generally it just recursively
copies the workspace directory `v0.1` to a new directory named `data`.

*If you're working with external tools (e.g. Git) on libraries, keep in mind
to access them with the new path instead of the old one.*

[NOTE]
====
After the workspace migration it can take several minutes until your
libraries are accessible because they are migrated to the new file format
in background.
====

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Once you open a LibrePCB 0.1.x project the first time with LibrePCB 1.x,
it will automatically be upgraded to the new file format. After saving it
to disk, it won't be possible anymore to open it with LibrePCB 0.1.x.

Note that although the upgrade is generally not critical, there _might_ be
small differences in your board after the upgrade. LibrePCB will show you a
list of what has changed during the upgrade.

Installation / Packaging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*From this release on, we do no longer provide an installer for Linux and
MacOS.* If you installed LibrePCB 0.1.x with the installer, we recommend to
uninstall it and then
https://librepcb.org/docs/installation/[install it with a different method].

For package maintainers: Note that LibrePCB now depends on Qt Quick,
OpenCascade, OpenGL and GLU (at build time and runtime). See details
https://developers.librepcb.org/d5/d96/doc_building.html[here].
