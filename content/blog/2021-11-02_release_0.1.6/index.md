title: LibrePCB 0.1.6 Released

After a whole year of development, we are very happy to finally announce
LibrePCB 0.1.6, which contains a lot of useful improvements!

### Highlights

#### LibrePCB Fab ([#927](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/927))

One major goal of the LibrePCB project is to make creating PCBs easier and
faster by removing unnecessary complexity of the PCB design workflow. However,
orderding PCBs with Gerber/Excellon files is still a hurdle, especially for
users not familiar yet with the traditional PCB production data workflow.

To remove this hurdle, we integrated a new service, called
[LibrePCB Fab](https://fab.librepcb.org/about), into the schematic- and board
editors. It allows to order PCBs in a very simple, fast way -- without
worrying about Gerber or Excellon files at all!

Although this service is intended mainly for beginners, it is actually even
useful for experienced users since it saves quite some time when ordering PCBs,
at least if you don't need the higher flexibility of the traditional
Gerber/Excellon export.

#### DXF Import ([#917](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/917))

This release finally adds an import for DXF files, the industry standard for
2D mechanical drawings. Instead of drawing polygons like package dimensions
or board outlines manually, you can now simply import them from a DXF file
right into the package- symbol- or board editor. Circles can optionally be
converted to holes, which is useful to import mounting holes together with
the board outlines.

For example, creating an Arduino Shield is now much easier once you got its
outline as a DXF:

#### Migration to CMake ([#798](https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/798))

Although this change is not directly relevant for LibrePCB users, it is still
noteworthy because of its impact for LibrePCB developers and package
maintainers.

Until LibrePCB 0.1.5, we used qmake as build system since it is the official
build system of Qt 5. But unfortunately, we had several issues with it,
especially regarding the integration and optional unbundling of third party
libraries.

Since CMake is the de facto standard for C++ projects, we have now migrated
LibrePCB to CMake as well. This allowed us to highly improve the way how
third party libraries can now be unbundled, which is very useful for package
maintainers. Note that even Qt 6 switched to CMake, one more good reason for
this step ;-)

Special thanks to [@dbrgn](https://github.com/dbrgn/) for the huge effort
spent for this migration!
