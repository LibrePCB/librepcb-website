The past 3 years were very exciting for me and the LibrePCB project, completely
different to the previous ca. 10 years of the project's existence. With this
post I'd like to give you some insights about my "new" everyday life.

Actually I don't like to expose my life in the internet. Maybe you aleady
noticed it if you ever tried to find me on social media platforms. I just
don't feel myself comfortable to share my life with the public (and with
all the profit-oriented companies grabbing that data). But since it's also
related to LibrePCB -- which I **do** want to share with the public -- let's
make an exception for this blog post.

Until mid 2022, my life was kind of "normal". Employed as an electrical
engineer, I was going to work 5 days (42 hours) per week, and worked on
LibrePCB in my free time evenings, on weekends and during holidays (I don't
know what else holidays are intended for). But after doing this routine for
many years, some things have changed over time, and the industry is only
interested in profit rather than developing useful, reliable products, I
felt like this is not the way to spend the rest of my life. So I quit my
safe job with no idea
how I will generate the income needed to pay the rent, food,
insurances etc. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to work harder on
LibrePCB as I was (and still am) convinced the world needs a proper
open-source EDA tool.

Honestly it was a tough decision and I hoped I won't regret it. Anyway, first
of all I enjoyed the new flexibility to travel a bit -- something I never did
on my own in my life. Well, "travel" means I take the laptop and go to nice
destinations where I can work from.
