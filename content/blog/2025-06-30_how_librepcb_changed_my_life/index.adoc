title: How LibrePCB Changed My Life

The past 3 years were very exciting for me and the LibrePCB project, completely
different to the previous ca. 10 years of the project's existence. With this
blog post I'd like to give you some insights about my "new" everyday life.

Actually I don't like to expose my life in the internet -- maybe you aleady
noticed this if you ever tried to find me on social media platforms. Though
there's nothing to hide, I just don't feel myself comfortable to share my
life with the public (and with all the profit-oriented companies grabbing
that data). But since it's also related to LibrePCB -- which I obviously
[.underline]#_do_# want to share with the public -- let's make an exception
for this blog post (well, I still couldn't resist to add this post to the
disallow list of `robots.txt`).

Until mid 2022, my life was kind of "normal". Full-time employed as an electrical
engineer, I was going to work 5 days (42 hours) per week, and worked on
LibrePCB in my free time evenings, on weekends and during holidays (I don't
know what else holidays are intended for...). But after doing this routine for
many years, some things have changed over time, and I realized the industry is only
interested in profit rather than developing useful, reliable products, I
felt like this is not the way to spend the rest of my life. So I quit my
safe job with no idea
how I will generate the income needed to pay the rent, food,
insurances etc. The only thing I knew was that I wanted to work harder on
LibrePCB as I was (and still am) convinced the world needs a proper
open-source EDA tool. This was the day my life got interesting.

Honestly it was a tough decision and I hoped I won't regret it. Anyway, first
of all I enjoyed the new flexibility to travel a bit -- something I never did
on my own in my life before. Well, "travel" means I took the laptop and went to
destinations where the weather was better than at my home in Switzerland and
where I can continue working on LibrePCB.

Not yet thinking about my future income, a friend & contributor of LibrePCB
(https://github.com/rnestler[@rnestler]) asked if I ever considered to apply
for a grant, e.g. from https://nlnet.nl/[NLnet]. I've never heard of it and was
not very optimistic that "next generation internet" is interested in supporting
a hardware-related project from a non-EU country, nevertheless I submitted
LibrePCB as there was nothing to loose. Their evaluation took quite long, during which
time I just continued working full-time on LibrePCB by using the savings I
could make with my previous job. This felt quite good, and even better when
from time to time an email from NLnet mentioned that LibrePCB made it into
the next evaluation round. Yay!

In the end, the evaluation took more than 4 months and it was
http://localhost:1313/blog/2023-04-13_ngi0_grant/[April 2023] -- already more
than 6 months without being employed -- when
the final decision was made that LibrePCB will be supported. It was a huge
surprise for me and I was very happy to finally have a significant income for
working on LibrePCB! This was a game-changer as it gave me the confidence
that I can work a full year on LibrePCB without needing to look for another
job -- no more worries about income, just focus on the development of
LibrePCB all day (and night)!

During this time, I was able to finish
http://localhost:1313/blog/2023-09-24_release_1.0.0/[LibrePCB 1.0]
and http://localhost:1313/blog/2024-04-03_release_1.1.0/[LibrePCB 1.1] with
tons of new features and improvements. It was a great time since I was
flexible in the way how I get the work done (e.g. it didn't matter if I worked
from 8AM to 5PM or from 11AM to midnight, or if I worked from cold home or from
a better climate zone). But the time was running, and
in April 2024 the grant ended with the release of LibrePCB 1.1. And so also
the income suddenly stopped (except the donations and sponsorings).

Then, luckily a friend asked me if I could do some freelance hardware & firmware
development for their company. Although I love to work on LibrePCB, it was
a no-brainer to accept this offer since it is a great way to stay flexible --
with freelance projects, it is much easier to keep enough free time for
LibrePCB compared to having a full-time job.

Unfortunately for legal reasons it was necessary to found a company (GmbH) to
do the freelance work. I was hot very happy about it, but thought it could
actually be a chance to build up a long-term side-income (if more freelance
projects follow) which would be great to keep enough free time for LibrePCB.
Long story short, I am now also a company owner (with myself as its only
employee) and need to do accounting, tax declaration and things like that ðŸ˜­
Not what I like to do (don't tell the Swiss authorities I have no idea about
it!) but one cannot have just the advantages without taking the downsides...

Now I've already finished three freelance projects and a fourth is in progress.
In two of them I even designed PCBs with LibrePCB, how cool is that! ðŸ˜ƒ Anyway,
thanks to the
http://localhost:1313/blog/2024-10-17_roadmap_2.0/[second NLnet grant] which
started in October 2024, I could focus back on LibrePCB, meaning roughly 90%
working on LibrePCB and 10% on the freelance project. Though interestingly
the 10% freelance project generates ca. 50% of the income ;-)

This working mode will stay until ca. October 2025 when the NLnet grant is
running out (and LibrePCB 2.0 should be finished). Afterwards it will get
interesting again how we will proceed. I already have some ideas in mind...
