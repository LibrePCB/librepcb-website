I am very proud to announce the release of LibrePCB 2.0.0 today, after 10
months of hard work! The implementation of a completely new UI with modern
technologies marks the beginning of a new era in the history of LibrePCB.
But there are also many other improvements and new features, check out the
details below.

Highlights
----------

This section showcases only a few of the huge amount of improvements. For a
complete list, refer to the <<Changelog,full changelog>> below, which also
contains links to the corresponding pull requests on GitHub where additional
details and screenshots are provided.

New User Interface (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/1494[#1494])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most obvious change in this release is the new user interface which was
built from scratch with the https://slint.dev[Slint] UI framework. It looks
very different to the old UI, but the main reason for this change is to
improve the user experience and productivity in several ways:

- Less windows, no more wasting time to switch between multiple windows
- Less modal dialogs & message boxes which interrupted the workflow
- Split windows and tabs for organizing the editors according to your needs
- Efficient use of screen space to maximize schematic/board working areas
- Clean & simple UI for the simple tasks, but also provide advanced controls
  when desired
- Provide hints and guides to make the UI self-explaining

Basically we have replaced 5 separate, single-purpose windows by a single
multi-purpose window. In that window you can have as many projects and
libraries open as you like, and in every tab you can work on a different task.
You can display the board next to its schematic, the 3D board viewer next to
the 2D board editor, or compare the schematics of two different projects
side-by-side. And on a multi-monitor setup, you can open multiple of those
windows which are all equivalent in functionality.

[.clearfix]
==== Library Manager

[.imageblock.float-lg-end.ms-3]
{{< imglink "library manager" "library-manager.gif" >}}

The library manager and the library editor are now also integrated into
this new window. The library manager has been rewritten from scratch to
heavily streamline the user experience.

The sidebar now even automatically notifies you about outdated libraries,
so you don't miss library updates anymore.

[.clearfix]
==== PCB Ordering

[.imageblock.float-lg-start.me-3]
{{< imglink "order pcb" "order-pcb.gif" >}}

The PCB ordering feature has been rewritten from scratch too and is now
integrated seamlessly into the main window.

It now automatically checks the ERC and DRC and warns about outdated DRC
messages before you place the order. The days are gone when we ordered
faulty PCBs because we forgot to run the DRC!

==== Enhanced 3D Viewer

[.clearfix]
****
[.imageblock.float-lg-end.ms-3]
{{< imglink "3d viewer" "3d-viewer.gif" >}}

The 3D viewer allows now to hide objects and layers individually to inspect
the PCB in every detail. Either just switch those layers on/off with a single
click, or use the four sliders to smoothly change their transparency.
****

[NOTE]
====
Please note that the new UI represents a huge step forward, and we're excited
to continue refining and extending it in upcoming releases. We have a clear
vision for making the UI even more intuitive and productive, and we're
actively working toward it.

We keep track of
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/1655[known limitations & issues]
of the new UI, and also about the
https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/issues/1494[planned short-term tasks].
Your feedback is invaluable to us -- if you experience any issues or have
suggestions not mentioned there, please

Schematic Buses (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1646[#1646])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.float-lg-start.me-3]
{{< imglink "schematic buses" "schematic-bus.png" "" 350 >}}

On our https://show.forms.app/librepcb/feedback/report[user feedback survey],
schematic buses are on rank 3 of the most requested features. Now we can
remove that feature from the wish list since it has been implemented. All
the basic functionlity is there, and more advanced functionality might be
provided in upcoming releases. With buses it is possible to group multiple
wires in one thick line, called _bus_, to keep the schematics clean and
readable.

[.clearfix]
Images in Symbols & Schematics (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1578[#1578])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.float-lg-end.ms-3]
{{< imglink "image in schematics" "schematic-images.png" "" 400 >}}

Ever wanted to add a diagram, formula, table or simply a company logo to a
schematic? This is now possible -- just paste any image from the clipboard into
the schematic (or load it from a file) and scale/rotate it as desired. Almost
every image format is supported, including SVG, PNG and JPEG.

[.clearfix]
Individual Pads in Boards (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1596[#1596])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.float-lg-start.me-3]
{{< imglink "pads in boards" "board-pads.png" "" 310 >}}

It has always been strange that pads (whether THT or SMT) or plated slots
could only be added to a board indirectly as part of footprints, i.e. through
the library system -- interestingly not only in LibrePCB, but also in other
EDA packages.

But sometimes we need individual, specialized pads or slots in boards e.g.
for mechanical purposes, where footprints make no sense. In LibrePCB 2.0 this
is now possible. Just add pads or slots to the board the same way as in the
footprint editor.

[.clearfix]
Advanced Design Rules (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1610[#1610], https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1611[#1611], https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1606[#1606], https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1608[#1608])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.float-lg-end.ms-3]
{{< imglink "via properties" "via-properties.png" "" 400 >}}

Also noteworthy are some improvements regarding design rules. It is now
possible to define the default trace width and via drill diameter in
the board settings, so you don't need to specify those properties anymore
when adding traces and vias to the board. And thanks to the automatic via
annular ring calculation, you never have to worry about outer via sizes anymore!

In addition, planes allow now to specify separate clearances to copper,
board outlines and holes.

[.clearfix]
Predefined Design Rules & Output Jobs (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1631[#1631])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.imageblock.float-lg-start.me-3]
{{< imglink "load drc settings" "load-drc-settings.png" "" 420 >}}

Have you ever entered all design rules according to the capabilities of a
particular PCB manufacturer? Probably not, as it is very cumbersome...

With LibrePCB 2.0 it is now possible to store design rules in a library
(within so-called _organizations_), which are then available to be
applied to boards. So you can store the design rules of your PCB manufacturer
in your local library, and load them into your boards later.

But the real advantage of this approach is that we can now deploy design rules
through our library manager! Just install the LibrePCB Base library and you
will benefit from the design rules we will add in future.

And this features goes even one step further. In addition to board design
rules, it is also possible to share _output jobs_ through this system. So
instead of fiddling around with Gerber/Excellon file names in every new
project, just load the predefined Gerber/Excellon settings for your PCB
manufacturer in a second!

Preferred Footprint Style (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1653[#1653])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[.clearfix]
****
[.imageblock.float-lg-end.ms-3]
{{< imglink "preferred footprints" "preferred-footprints.png" >}}

Our library concept already allows a package to provide multiple footprints,
for example one for hand soldering and another for reflow soldering. With
LibrePCB 2.0, this feature gets especially powerful since you can now specify
your preferred soldering technique in the board, so LibrePCB will choose the
corresponding footprints automatically.

In addition to the soldering technique, it is also possible to specify the
desired IPC density level, which impacts the size of the pads.

_Note that this feature relies on so-called 'tags' which need to be added to
the footprints in the libraries. Not all our official footprints have those
tags yet, so it might take some time until this feature is fully operational._
****

Upgrading from LibrePCB 1.x
---------------------------

If you're currently using LibrePCB 1.x, please note that the manual
fabrication output dialogs for Gerber/Excellon export and BOM export have
been removed in favor of the more powerful output jobs. Use output jobs now
to generate any production data. If you used the fabrication output dialog
before, you can simply import those settings as a new Gerber/Excellon
output job.

[WARNING]
====
When you open a LibrePCB 1.x project the first time with LibrePCB 2.x, it
will be automatically migrated to a new file format. After saving it, you
can no longer open it with LibrePCB 1.x, so please review the project
before saving.
====

[TIP]
====
When you open a LibrePCB 1.x workspace the first time with LibrePCB 2.x, all
libraries will be migrated to the new file format in the background library
scan. Therefore it is expected that the first scan takes much longer than
usual.
