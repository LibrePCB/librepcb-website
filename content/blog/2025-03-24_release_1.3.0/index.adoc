Today we released LibrePCB 1.3.0 with an interactive HTML BOM export,
several bugfixes and more! See the full changelog below.

Highlights
----------

Note that this is mainly a bugfix release and most features currently
in development will land in the LibrePCB 2.0 release which still takes
some time. Nevertheless there are some noteworthy changes in this release.

Interactive HTML BOM (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1485[#1485])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Printing out the assembly plan and the BOM for manual PCB assembly and marking
the assembled parts line by line is no longer required thanks to a new output
job. Instead of a PDF, you'll get the assembly plan as a HTML file which is
interactive -- you can sort, filter, search or mark parts as assembled
using a web browser. Instead of a paper sheet, you could use your laptop or
tablet on your desk while assembling the PCB step by step.

The HTML/CSS/JS core of this feature is from the existing
https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom[Ineractive HTML BOM]
project, already well known as a KiCad plugin. In LibrePCB, this is now a
built-in feature! icon:rocket[]

KiCad v9 Compatibility (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1492[#1492])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As KiCad v9 was released with some changes in its library file format, we
updated our KiCad library importer to support that new file format. Of
course older file formats are still supported, and actually their
compatibility was even improved too in this release.

Initial Usage of Rust (https://github.com/LibrePCB/LibrePCB/pull/1477[#1477])
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Though not directly relevant for our users, this change is still noteworthy
as it highly affects the development of LibrePCB. After more than 10 years of
implementing LibrePCB entirely in C++, this release contains the very first
code written in the https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust programming language].

The reasoning behind this is explained in the blog post
link:{{< relref "blog/2024-10-17_roadmap_2.0/index.adoc" >}}[NGI0 Grant for LibrePCB 2.0].
While this is not directly visible in the LibrePCB application, users still
profit indirectly from potentially higher stability and faster development.

In this release, there are two software modules implemented in Rust: The
interactive HTML BOM generator mentioned above, and the library for reading
and writing ZIP files.
