I'm happy to announce that we will have a talk to present LibrePCB 2.0 at the
next https://fosdem.org/[FOSDEM] in Brussels!

As the LibrePCB 2.0 release will be ready soon, it will be the main topic
of my presentation. But I'll also give a short update about the project
itself (e.g. funding) and some insights into the development. And as usual,
we will have a few minutes for a Q&A session. So if you're curious about the
progress of LibrePCB, feel free to join the conference -- either in person or
via live stream.
