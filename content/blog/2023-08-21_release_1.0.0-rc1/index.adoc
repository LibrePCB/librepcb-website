title: LibrePCB 1.0.0 RC1 Released
author: U. Bruhin

I'm very excited to announce that LibrePCB 1.0 is feature-complete and that
a first release candidate is available for download!

About This Release Candidate
----------------------------

LibrePCB 1.0 contains a huge amount of changes compared to the previous
release. Even though we give our best to keep the quality high and do lots
of testing, such large changes always come with the risk of bugs. Thus, we
first provide a release candidate prior to the official stable release.

Note that while we do not expect that any serious problems occur with your projects
when using this release candidate, it's still a good
idea to create a backup first (e.g. by using a version control
system).

If you experience any issues with this release candidate, please

so we can fix them in the final release!
